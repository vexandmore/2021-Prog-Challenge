# What is this? #
This contains unofficial solutions to the CRC's 2021 programming challenge.
Currently, problems 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are solved, each in their own main class (ie, class with a 
```
public static void main(String[] args) 
```
function).
It is written in Java. The structure is as an Eclipse project, but no external libraries are used, so the source files for each Problem are compilable on their own.
